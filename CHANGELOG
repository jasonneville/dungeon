Changelog:

1/24: Started project. Able to implement grid with borders and rooms present.
1/25: Implemented corridors that connect rooms. Staircase generation completed as well.
1/30: Changed corridor generation to make random steps in x and y direction to avoid very linear corridors. Finished project.
2/5: Started working on file reading and writing. Able to get the home path and switch statements to work.
2/6: Able to start writing bytes to dungeon file and reading them back and printing them to screen. Got until the staircases and was having trouble with structs. 
     Changed rooms array to structs and created structs for up and down stairs.
2/7: Finished hw2. Was able to successfully read and write to dungeon and display the same dungeon repeatedly. Was able to fix structs error by creating a pointer
     and allocating memory when I was able to find out space required for them. Created new functions to make rooms given dimensions rather than generating them. 
     Tested Sheaffer's sample files and successfully displayed them all perfectly. 
2/13: Started HW3. Copied in Sheaffer's dijkstra algorithm and added some structs to help functionality. Was having trouble getting distance maps to generate correctly.
      Was also having trouble figuring out what to do with the .from parts.
2/14: Finished HW3. Deleted all .from parts and added parameters to both functions to include pc position, 2d arrays for tunneling and non-tunneling. Change cost calculations
      for both to 1 + (hardness / 85) and 1. Cleaned up code for readibility's sake. Ran into problem where my graph was printing perfectly close to the PC but was off by a modulus
      of 1 at the fringe of the graph.
2/23: Started HW4. Was able to create monster generation as well as displaying the monsters to the dungeon.
2/25: Changed implementation to include a parallel array of characters so that the dungeon floor is never changed. Started to implement the queue but was confused on implementation.
2/26: Worked on implementing the heap. Was able to create the working heap that was able to successfully run by comparing the turn values of individual monster's structs. 
2/27: Finished HW4. Put finishing touches on end-game scenario and heap. Came up with monster movement based on their characteristics. Was able to implement erratic, tunneling, and non-tunneling
	  behavior.  
3/4: Started HW5. Able to implement previous homework solution in ncurses. Started to add functionality to pc movement input.
3/5: Continued with implementing user input keys. Was able to implement all 8 types of character movement and pause movements.
3/6: Finished all user inputs except for displaying monster list and scrolling capabilities. 
3/12: Finsihed HW5. Was able to implement displaying and scrolling monster list repeatedly. Fixed bug where turns would be completed by monsters when displaying and escaping from monster list menu. 
3/20: Started HW6. Ported over all c code to c++ code but was running into the error when using dynamic cast that said 'CXXABI_1.3.9' not found
3/21: Continued to try to fix the dynamic cast error. Was unable to make any progress
3/25: Switched implementation of monster array and created a pc class that inserts into the heap separately to remedy the dynamic cast error. Also implemented the fog of war view and added teleportation functionality. Ran into the error of getting a floating point exception when teleporting into rock. 
3/26: Fixed the floating point exception and added random teleportation functionality to the game. Fixed reading and saving to disc errors that I had commented out when porting rest of project to c++.
3/27: Cleaned up code and checked game for errors. Added bolded text for displaying the visual 5x5 block. Finished HW6.
3/31: Started HW7. Was able to read in most fields from text file, leaving out the colors and description. 
4/1: Continued to work on hw. Was able to implement description. Was running into the issue of pointer not getting correct values from other function. Discovered that it was because c++ pointers behave a little differently than what I thought I was doing. Fixed the issue.
4/2: Finished HW7. Updated README and CHANGELOG.
4/9: Started HW8. Able to place monsters and was running into the issue of object pointer array not updating correctly.
4/10: Finished HW8. Fixed error with object pointer array that was being of scope issues. Added color implementation to all map views. 
4/14: Started HW9. Added menus and pick up features.
4/15: Completed rest of command implementation.
4/16: Added combat and switching of monster positions.
4/17: Completed HW9. Fixed some errors with switching positions with monsters and pc combat. 
4/22: Started HW10. Implemented lighting and started with implementing spellbooks.
4/23: Completed HW10. Added magic combat system that has 3 different spellbooks. Added health and mana generation based on last turn difference.
